# GoBull - A Redis-backed Message Queue in Go

GoBull is a lightweight, high-performance message queue built in Go, inspired by BullMQ. It provides job **scheduling**, **delayed execution**, **automatic retries**, and **distributed processing** using Redis.

## Features üöÄ

- **Job Queuing** - Push jobs to a queue and process them asynchronously.

- **Delayed Jobs** - Schedule jobs to run after a specific delay.

- **Automatic Retries** - Failed jobs are retried with exponential backoff.

- **Worker System** - Register workers to handle specific job types.

- **Distributed Processing** - Scale workers across multiple instances.

- **Persistent Storage** - Uses Redis to store and manage jobs.
